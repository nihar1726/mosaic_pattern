## 🧩 Mosaic Pattern Creator

A desktop application that transforms images into stunning mosaic artworks using customizable tile shapes, sizes, and color modes.

## ✨ Overview

**Mosaic Pattern Creator** lets users load any image and generate a beautiful mosaic effect. You can adjust tile size, choose between different shapes (Square, Circle, or Hexagon), and apply various color processing modes for artistic effects — all through an elegant, Qt-based interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 **Image Loading** — Supports PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP formats  
- 🎨 **Multiple Tile Shapes** — Square ▪️ | Circle ⚪ | Hexagon ⬡  
- ⚙️ **Customizable Tile Size** — Adjustable between 5 and 100 pixels  
- 🌈 **Color Modes**  
  - **Average:** Uses the average color per tile  
  - **Dominant:** Uses the dominant color (currently approximated via average)  
  - **Quantized:** Reduces image colors for a stylized appearance  
- 💾 **Save & Export** — Export your generated mosaics as PNG or JPEG files  
- 🖥️ **Modern GUI** — Built with **Qt6**, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

| Component         | Responsibility                                    |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ImageProcessor    | Loads and prepares source image using OpenCV      |
| MosaicGenerator   | Applies mosaic logic based on parameters          |
| UI                | Handles GUI rendering and user interactions (Qt)  |
| Utils             | Helper functions for color and math utilities     |

---

## Design Highlights

- Modular Architecture — Clear separation of logic and interface  
- RAII Principles — Safe memory management for OpenCV & Qt objects  
- Factory-like Tile Handling — Generates shapes dynamically based on user choice  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Import custom tile patterns
- Text or emoji-based mosaics
- Photo mosaics using secondary images
- Real-time live preview
- Batch image processing
- Export color palette as text file
- 3D rendering of mosaic tiles

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

**CMake can’t find Qt6**  
Ensure Qt6 is installed and point CMake to its directory:

```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt6
```

**OpenCV not found**  
Specify its installation path manually if needed:

```
cmake .. -DOpenCV_DIR=/path/to/opencv
```

**Build errors on Windows**  
Use MSVC 2017+ or MinGW  
Verify all dependencies are correctly installed and linked

Enjoy creating beautiful mosaic art! 🎨🧩
